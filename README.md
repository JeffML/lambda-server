This project reproduces the issue where `netlify deploy --prod` works, but github-triggered deployment does not.


**Netlify command line tool**
VERSION
  netlify-cli/2.20.1 linux-x64 node-v12.9.1

**notes**
Make sure you do a `yarn install` in the functions folder in addition to the top-level one.
